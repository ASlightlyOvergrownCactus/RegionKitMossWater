A data pearl with a hole burned through its center, tied with some sort<LINE>of twined plant fiber. I can't read the pearl, it's far too damaged. 

Did you get this from the scavengers? I'd advise that you don't take pearls from them,<LINE><PLAYERNAME> - they value them quite highly and can be dangerous if provoked.

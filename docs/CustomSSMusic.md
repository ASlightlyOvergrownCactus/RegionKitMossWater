# How To Add Custom Iterator Music (SSMusic)

1: Make a text file in your region mod called "customssmusic" (not case sensitive)

2: The format is as follows:

XX : SomeSongName
IR : RW_86 - The Cycle

- **Do not** include anything other than what is shown in the example above.
- Custom songs should be placed in: YourModFolder > Music > Songs.
- **Only write the song name** in the formatâ€”**do not** include the file extension (.ogg, .wav, etc.).

3: Use the SSMusic room effect in your region
- **PS: SSMusic only works if you have zero gravity**

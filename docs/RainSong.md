# How to make a Rain Song
Rain Song files must be placed in the music/songs folder. Like other music files, they must be OGG. The first two letters of the song file must be the region ID, in lowercase. The file name must contain "rainsong" in some place.
Examples:
music/songs/su_rainsong.ogg
music/songs/vs_MySuperCoolRainSong_rainsong.ogg
music/songs/ip_rainsongiranoutofnamesfor.ogg
